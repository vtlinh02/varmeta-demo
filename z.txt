flow in the git pull:

git pull run, get the output
from the output, we have a list of file change
    check if this file is equal to project change => create or update the project
    check if this file is equal to categories change (parent category)


the users of our system: 
    user: 
        create new sub category where this category have information about the project => done
        create new project with existed sub category => done
        update existed project => done
        delete existed project ( does this have this case? )
    admin
        create new parent category, maybe the admin will create some sub category
        (merge valid pull request)

        cac case delete, cac truong hop nao se xay ra?

Rule
    when create sub category, need to create at least one project in that sub category, if not, then what the sub use for?

=> from the git pull command, handle the "tuong ung" case
